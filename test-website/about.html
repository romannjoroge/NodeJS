        <h1>About Page</h1>
        <p>I'll be very shocked if you can see this page.
            <p class="new-text">I said this before running some tests.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I didn't add a route to this page manually with code and let express handle it for me
            <p class="new-text">All pages except a static index.html needs to be added a route in code in order for
                the server to know what to do
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>Let us see what happens!
            <p class="new-text">The page didn't show up</p>
        </p>
