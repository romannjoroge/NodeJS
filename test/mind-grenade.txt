The util module is awesome cause it let me combine first.txt and second.txt without going through callback hell!!
        This is the result:
        Hello this is a first text file. : Hello this is the second text file.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF THE START FUNCTION SPEAKING
            YOU NO LONGER NEED TO EVEN PROMISIFY FUNCTIONS WITH THE UTILS MODULE THANKS TO IMPORTING WITH PROMISES MODULE
            BASK IN MY GLORY!!!!!!!!
            Hello this is a first text file. : Hello this is the second text file.
