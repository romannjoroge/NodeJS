NPM
- NPM is the package manager used in node
- You install packages locally using npm install<package-name>
- To install pacakges globally you run npm install -g <package-name>

- To create a package.json file you run the comman npm init -y
- To create a npm script you change scripts section of package.json
- You run scripts by running npm <script-name> or npm run <script-name>

- To uninstall a npm package you run npm uninstall <package-name>

- npx allows you to run packages as if they were installed globally in your machine

EVENT LOOP
- It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations -despite the fact that Javascript is single 
  threaded - by offloading operations to the system kernel
- Javascript being single-threaded means that it reads the code line by line. So code is executed only when
  the code above it is completely executed. This can cause issues when the code above takes a long time to run
- The issue above can be solved by offloading code execution to the system as Javascript runs the rest of 
  the code

EVENTS
- Actions in NodeJS are driven by EVENTS
- Use the events module require('events')
- on - listen for an event
  emit - emit an event
- one event can have many listeners that have different callback functions
- You first listen for an event before emitting it
